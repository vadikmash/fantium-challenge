# Fantium Challenge

A challenge from Fantium for Full Stack developers.

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

# TODO

- [ ] Improve layout responsiveness for 13-inch laptop screens. Currently the page doesn't completely fit on smaller laptop screens and the user needs to scroll to see the the bottom of it, which is not desirable behavior in this case.
- [ ] Design and implement expanded version of the collection card, that would display all the info, that currently doesn't fit in the card.
- [ ] Improve project structure:
  - move logic from routers to dedicated services
  - switch to atomic design for frontend components
- [ ] Add a proper favicon, what would scale well and work with all browsers (`.ico` version, `.svg` version, various resolutions, webmanifest, etc.). Use this [generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) for help.
